                order
                items, custom built items will not be able to be returned. For this reason it is extremely important to

                too
                much then contact us for a special shipping quote. If there is an error in the shipping rate quoted we

        <p class="paragraph">
            If a product is ordered and not wanted, the UNUSED item can be returned for up to a 25% restocking fee. This
            is dependent on the manufacturer or vendor. Shipping is not refundable in either direction. All items
            wanting to be returned MUST be reported within 30 days of the shipped date. No items will be returnable
            after 30 days. All products shipped from the Top Level Motorsport warehouse are shipped via Fedex or Freight

            require signatures for package release. Fedex, UPS, and DHL have package pick up locations if you are unable
            to sign for the package. If the package is returned to Top Level Motorsport or the manufacturer/vendor, you
            will be responsible for the return shipping costs and pay a restocking fee.</p>

            <b>Warranty</b>
            All products come with a warranty that is applied directly by the manufacturer. Unless you purchase a
            extended warranty, Top Level Motorsport does not offer any of our own warranties and are not responsible for
            product failures or failures due to installation. Certain products are intended for race use only as
            suggested by the manufacture and should be installed and set up by professional service centers ONLY. As
            stated above we are not responsible for shipping cost other than by our own mistake of incorrect shipping.
            Any item that is altered or changed from its original state without the consent of the manufacturer or Top
            Level Motorsport, will not be able to be returned or receive warranty support. The warranty of a product is
            facilitated by Top Level Motorsport, however we can only enforce the manufactures decisions.
            By law, a dealership is not allowed to void a warranty based upon having aftermarket parts installed on a
            car. When you add an aftermarket part to the car, the aftermarket part will void the warranty of ONLY the
            stock part it is replacing.
        </p>
