        <h2>Shipping and Returns</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">All products are shipped via UPS or FedEx <b> SIGNATURE REQUIRED</b> (unless otherwise
            specified).</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Please allow up to 48 hours to process and ship your <b><i>in-stock order;</i></b> orders for items that are
            not in-stock can take much longer. If you have a time sensitive shipment please give us a call to ensure
            there are no delays.
            <br>
            All products are shipped out from one of the authorized Top Level Motorsport shipping locations. Top Level
            Motorsport drop-ships most orders, while some orders ship directly from our main facility. Special
            arrangements may need to be made for international orders and oversize packages.
            <br>
            In the event a product arrives damaged to your location, please follow the steps listed below. All damaged
            items must be reported to the shipping carrier immediately and you must notify Top Level Motorsport within
            <b>48 Hours</b> of receiving your order. If these steps are not followed, your shipment may be denied claim
            to our
            Guarantees and a refund.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <b>If you receive a damaged product, please do the following:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>IMMEDIATELY CONTACT US</li>
                <li>Keep the product with its original packaging and box</li>
                <li>Make a list of the damaged or lost item(s)</li>
                <li>Top Level Motorsport will contact the shipper once we receive the email info above to schedule a
                    pickup
                    if needed. DO NOT send it back to the return address without written approval from Top Level
                    Motorsport.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Once the product is received back and inspected, a replacement or credit will be issued.
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The shipping rates shown at time of checkout on our site are based on a weight guesstimate and then
            formulated via a UPS shipping program. The rates do not take into account dimensions. If your shipment
            weight is higher than the online cart can process, please contact us for a shipping quote. <b>If there is an
                error in the shipping rate quoted we will contact you and let you know of the changes.</b> International
            orders (Outside the USA) are not automatically processed as we may require additional information from you

        <p class="paragraph">
            <i>
                An order that has shipped from our location or a supplier can not be canceled, these are classified as
                returns. Unfortunately once it has shipped restocking fees will apply if they are applicable. Special
                order
                items, custom built items will not be able to be returned. For this reason it is extremely important to
                check your invoice or order form.
            </i>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            If a product is ordered and not wanted, the UNUSED item can be returned for a 25% restocking fee. In some
            cases, we may offer the ability to return the item to us for a lesser restocking fee and then keep the
            balance as a store credit. To return an item, it must be in brand new condition with original packaging. If
            the item cannot be resold or is a special order or custom made item, we cannot accept a return. Shipping is
            non refundable in either direction unless approved by Top Level Motorsport. All items wanting to be returned
            MUST be reported within 30 days of the original invoice date. No items will be returnable after 30 days. All
            products shipped from the Top Level Motorsport warehouse are shipped via FedEx, USPS, or Freight and require
            a signature when delivered. Some packages shipped from the manufacturer may or may not require signatures
            for package release. FedEx, UPS, USPS, and DHL have package pick up locations if you are unable to sign for
            the package. If the package is returned to Top Level Motorsport or manufacturer, you will be responsible for
            the return shipping costs and pay a 25% restocking fee if you choose to not have the item reshipped. These
            fees will be charged to your account on file or will be invoiced to you.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            <b>Special Order Items</b>
            <br>
            Some items may be specially ordered specifically for the customer’s vehicle. These items generally require a
            deposit or paid in full. Once this deposit amount is notified to the customer and they agree to order the
            special order item, the deposit becomes non-refundable. These special order items cannot be returned or
            resold. Cancellations are not allowed on special order parts.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            <b> International Shipping</b>
            <br>

            with the importation of products purchased from Top Level Motorsport or our affiliates are the
            responsibility of the buyer. Any costs resulting from the refusal to import a product purchased through Top
